# cricket_run_predictor
A machine learning project working with historic cricket data trained to predict an average team's expected runs per over.

A requirements.txt file is included with the relvant packages used in the project. The project is split into data, jupyter, and scripts folders. All raw data to start is contained in a zip file under data/raw, and intermediate data/results/plots have been saved along the way as well. The core python is contained in files under jupyter/code, and are broken up into preprocessing, analytics, visualization, and modeling. The scripts folder contains the command line invocation method and a script to call that method from bash with the requested params. The code is intended to be flexible and stand alone, but there are also two jupyter notebook files demonstrating the various functionality.

To execute any of the examples, simply launch the Jupyter server, navigate to the desiered worksheet in browser, and run the provided starter code.
